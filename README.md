# Apex Tracker Project
## Personal project (practicing working on API with R)
**'Active' tab**: Users are able to search any Apex Legend players, it will show the stats for that player, such as steam name (if exist), active legend, kills, damage, and wins.\
\
**'Top Three' tab**: Same as the first tab, however, it will show the player's top three legends (based on their kills) and create a bar graph based on the information. (I have yet to implement the whole functionality, so this is a placeholder for now--demonstrating how the final version will appear.)
